<p>FOR RELEASE October 25, 2013<BR/>Media Contact: Brandon Gulya (<a href="mailto:brandongulya@gmail.com">brandongulya@gmail.com</a>)<p>
<p>NEW YORK, NY â€” Whale Thief, a sketch comedy group from the Upright Citizen's Brigade Theatre in New York, announced today the successful production of an entire feature-length film in a single day. On October 19th the group organized an event called "Movie Cram," in which a team of over 100 writers, directors, actors, producers, artists and musicians worked together to write, shoot, edit and premiere a feature-length comedy film in a single 24-hour period. Initial production began at midnight the morning of October 19th, and the final product was screened at midnight the following night in front of a sold-out live audience at the UCB Theatre in New York, NY. Although not yet official, this is a world record.</p>

<p>The film, entitled "A New McDonald's," was executive produced by Whale Thief, which consists of Benjamin Apple (Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, UCB), Brandon Gulya (MTV's Two Guys Named Josh, The Food Network, Official Bonaroo Announcement with Weird Al Yankovic, UCB), Matt Klinman (Adult Swim, The Onion, UCB), Matt Mayer (NickMom, College Humor, Onion, MTV, UCB), and Zack Poitras (The Onion, Pangea, UCB). Along with them were 12 writers, 20 directors, and 76 actors. Factoring in editors, production assistants, musicians responsible for creating the original score of the film, and many other volunteers, the project has well over a hundred names in its credits.</p>

<p>Whale Thief has since realized that the extremely short production time for this movie accidentally qualifies it for a World Record, beating a few other films that hit around the 11-day mark. No Guinness World Record people were around to verify it because, truthfully, this was never a goal. But, nonetheless, the event was well-documented and had lots of witnesses.</p>
